## Description
The official server for our "Digitaler-BÃ¼cherschrank" app. Stay tuned for coming up things!
Based on NestJS 


## Installation

```bash

## Running the app

You need to create a config.ts in src/ which has the following structure:
```typescript
export const Config = {
  "connection_string": "", // Connection string to the (mongodb) database 
  "api_key": "", // Access key for the isbn-db API
  "secret": "", // Any random string used for generating JWT Tokens for authentication
  "working_dir": "" // Directory of src/, needed for maintenance mode checks
};
```


Starting the server:
```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```
